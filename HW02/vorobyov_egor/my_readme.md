* ### Small description about task
- I used version `ruby-2.7.0` 
- I did my custom class `MyArray` for creating arrays.
- I did my custom module `Func` functions which are incuded into custom iterator which place in class `MyArray`.
- I did my custom module `Predicates` for small functions which are incuded into module `Func`. 
  Theese small functions help us make conditionals and structure my code.
- I created my arr and called my custom iterators on it in `index.js` with comparing default iterators of instance Array.
